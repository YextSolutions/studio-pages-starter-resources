# studio-pages-starter-resources

This repository contains the configuration resources to use the [Studio Pages Starter](https://github.com/YextSolutions/studio-pages-starter). It contains a sample entity as well as entity type and field configuration.

Studio is a tool that lets Admins and Developers alike build React Applications with ease. For now, we're focused on Applications corresponding to a Site. But, that may change in the future. It provides a no-code, visual editor that allows users to add and remove Components to pages, and configure Components on a page. 

As users perform operations in the Editor, Studio is writing human-readable, well formulated TSX files to the repo. Developers can easily work with, and directly modify, these TSX files outside Studio, as need be.
